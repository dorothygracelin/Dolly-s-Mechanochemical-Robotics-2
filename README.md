# Dolly's Mechanochemical Robotics 2

## 3D Biomedical Soft Robot Simulation Viewer

An interactive 3D browser-based simulation of a biomedical soft robot with magnetite-derived magnetic properties and AI spectroscopic sensing capabilities.

### Features

- **3D Visualization**: Real-time 3D rendering of the soft robot with bug-like appearance
- **Interactive Controls**: Rotate, pan, and zoom to explore the robot from all angles
- **Magnetite Material**: Dark metallic appearance representing the spreadable magnetic product
- **AI Spectroscopic Sensing**: Visualized through animated sensor particles and glowing antenna sensors
- **Magnetic Field Visualization**: Animated magnetic field rings showing the robot's magnetic properties
- **Miniature Bug-like Design**: Six-legged structure with articulated segments

### How to Use
