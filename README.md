# Dolly's Mechanochemical Robotics - Simulation 2

## Biomedical Soft Robot Browser Simulation

This is the second robotics simulation showcasing a **hypothetical biomedical soft robot** - a vision for applying waste valorization processes to robotics engineering.

### About the Project

This simulation demonstrates a soft robotic system made from sustainable materials derived through mechanochemical waste valorization processes. The robot features flexible actuators and biocompatible components.
