# Dolly's Mechanochemical Robotics - Simulation 2

## Biomedical Soft Robot Browser Simulation

This is the second robotics simulation showcasing a **hypothetical biomedical soft robot** - a vision for applying waste valorization processes to robotics engineering.

### About the Project

This simulation demonstrates a soft robotic system made from sustainable materials derived through mechanochemical waste valorization processes. The robot features flexible actuators and biocompatible components that could be used in medical applications.

### How to View the Simulation

1. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
2. The simulation will load with an interactive 3D visualization
3. Use the control buttons to interact with the robot:
   - **Start Simulation**: Begin the animated movement
   - **Pause**: Stop the animation
   - **Reset**: Return to initial state
   - **Contract**: Compress the robot segments
   - **Expand**: Extend the robot segments

### Key Concepts

**Waste Valorization**: The process of converting waste materials into valuable products through mechanochemical processes, creating sustainable materials for robotics.

**Soft Robotics**: A subfield of robotics focusing on robots made from compliant materials, enabling safe interaction with humans and adaptation to complex environments.

**Biomedical Applications**: Potential uses include minimally invasive surgery, drug delivery, tissue engineering, and medical diagnostics.
